Beneath the sun or floodlight's gleam,

Cricket lives like a waking dream.

A field of green, a willowed sound,

Where legends rise and tales are found.

From dusty lanes where barefoot boys,

Chase every run with shrieks of joy,

To packed arenas roaring loud,

The game unites a global crowd.

A coin is tossed, the captains stare,

As tension thickens in the air.

Bat or bowl? A choice so bold,

A story new begins, retold.

The openers walk, calm yet brave,

Each stride a wave upon the wave.

They face the ball with narrowed eyes,

As silence grips the watching skies.

The bowler runs, a rhythmic beat,

Like thunder galloping on feet.
